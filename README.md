# wfs2json
PHP Script that request a Web Feature Service (WFS) and convert the received GML-Data to a JSON File.
It is designed to convert a GML-File with information about care services. It can easily be changed to convert also other simple GML application schemas.

May be it will change later to a more generic way.

To configure the output for filter or translation of values, copy constants_sample.ini to constants.ini and add what ever you whant to configure.
